What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

THe directory becomes a git repository. We need it to track the changes in the 
files we are doing and storing various versions of it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is the one which contains all the files of the directory. If we
want to put it in the repository, first we add it in the staging area. All files that 
we have to put in a single commit are put in the staging area at the same time.
It will show if the files need commit, and if yes, we can commit the changes and 
thus the new version will be added to our repository.
