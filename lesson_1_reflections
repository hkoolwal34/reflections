How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It made easy to pinpoint the exact location of difference without manually searching it.
Thus, the time was reduced for the laborious task.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer
in the long term?

I will know all the changes made in the orignal file to reach the current file. Thus if at a later
stage, I identify that something is wrong with the current file, I will have all the previous 
versions to restore the old content.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do 
in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - Every commit will signify a logical change.
There wont be a lot of versions that are unnecessary.

Cons - We might forget to commit a big change
Some logical change might be a big one, that may require some smaller commits too.

****

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because the files might be linked to each other, thus change in one file must be reflected in all 
the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log displays the log of all the commits of the repository. It also shows the commit message by 
which we can identify what change has been made in the commit.

git diff helps us to compare the two files by entering its commit id. The insertions are shown by
+sign and green color whereas the deletions are shown by -sign and red color.

****

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I'll save the previous changes by committing them, and then work ahead with the progress. If I find 
a bug, then i will go back to other commits to find where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For making all my projects, as it is easy to look upon previous codes and changes
