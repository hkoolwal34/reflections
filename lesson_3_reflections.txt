When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want it to be accessible to everyone and anywhere

****

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because many people may be working on the same project, which I may not want to 
incorporate at present. Thus manually pulling changes will provide me the flexibility
to get the changes whenever I wish.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

Forks are used to clone someone's github repository to our own github account.
Clones are used to copy the repository from remote to local machine or local to local 
machine.
Branches are used to work on different features simultaneously.
