When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want it to be accessible to everyone and anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because many people may be working on the same project, which I may not want to 
incorporate at present. Thus manually pulling changes will provide me the flexibility
to get the changes whenever I wish.
